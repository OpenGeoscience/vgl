VGL is a lightweight rendering library for scientific visualization and applications. It provides
a object level API for WebGL. The high level API provided by the VGL is essential for building
sophisticated visualization applications over the web.

For information on how to build VGL on your system please refer to http://vgl.readthedocs.org. 
VGL is developed as part of ClimatePipes project which is funded by Department of Energy (DOE).
